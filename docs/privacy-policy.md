# Privacy Policy

Jelu Importer operates entirely within your browser. The extension never sends usage data, browsing history, analytics,
or diagnostics to me or any third party. It only interacts with:

- The book catalog page you explicitly activate via the toolbar button (Goodreads, Amazon, Google Books, Audible).
- Your own Jelu server, using the base URL and credentials you configure inside the extension.
- The Google Books API, but only when you are on a Google Books page and request metadata enrichment.

## Data Collection

- **No personal data** is collected, stored, or transmitted by the developer of this extension.
- The extension stores preferences (Jelu URL, username, password, default tags, logging toggle) locally using the
  browser's storage APIs so you don't have to re-enter them. These values never leave your browser unless your Jelu
  server requires them to authenticate import requests.
- Import logs and status notifications are generated locally and are not sent anywhere else.

## Third-Party Services

The extension interacts only with the services listed above. It does not embed analytics, trackers, or advertising.

## Future Changes

If this policy ever changes, updates will be documented here and in the release notes. As of the current release, there
are no plans to collect any user information.
